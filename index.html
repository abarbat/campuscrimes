      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p>The information on this website was provided by the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-9/Table_9_Offenses_Known_to_Law_Enforcement_by_State_by_University_and_College_2014.xls/view">FBI's most recent statistics on US campus crime</a>.</p>
      <p>From the data, the following conclusions were drawn:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Property crime and larceny-theft were the most prevalent crimes on campus, together making up more than 90 percent of the crimes.</li>
        <li>Murder and arson were the least prevalent, together comprising less than one percent of crimes.</li>
        <li>High student population did not necessarily correlate with high crime rates.</li>
        <li>The average crime rate in the U.S. was 18.18 crimes per 1,000 students.</li>
        <li>Crime rates were lowest in the Midwest and highest in the South.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <h3>FBI data</h3>
      <p>The information on this website was provided by the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-9/Table_9_Offenses_Known_to_Law_Enforcement_by_State_by_University_and_College_2014.xls/view">FBI's most recent statistics on US campus crime</a>.</p>
      <p>The following items explain the disclaimers inlcuded in the FBI data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The figures are provided by the United States Department of Education. They are for the 2013 school year, which is the most recent available. The figures include full-time and part-time students.</li>
      </li>Rapes are reported under either the legacy or the revised FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program definition of rape. This is because the definition of rape was redefined by the program. Some agencies began the year submitting rape data classified according to the legacy UCR definition and, at some point in the year, modified reporting methods and began classifying and submitting rape offenses according to the revised definition. The definitions listed by the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-9/table-9-data-declaration">FBI data declaration page</a> are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Rape (revised definition): Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. (This includes the offenses of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object as converted from data submitted via the National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS]).</li>
        <li>Rape (legacy definition): The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Some  data was not collected because the FBI did not receive 12 complete months of data from the reporting agency.</li>
      <li>Student enrollment figures were not available for some schools.</li>
      <li>Because of changes in the state/local agency's reporting practices, figures for some schools are not comparable to previous years' data. Download the original data <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-9/Table_9_Offenses_Known_to_Law_Enforcement_by_State_by_University_and_College_2014.xls">here</a> for more specific information.</li>
      <li>It is important to rememeber when comparing campuses that campus crime statistics are influenced by factors such as the demographics of the community in which the school is located, the number of residents living on campus versus commuting to school and size.</li>
      </ul>
